    "In case you aren't familiar, oh hell is a trick taking game a little bit like hearts. The major difference is that at the start of each round, each participant guesses how many tricks they will take. You only get points if you get *exactly* that many tricks. Another peculiarity of the game is that the size of the hand changes each round, starting at ten and going down by one till you are dealt just a single card. "

Let's assume you've dealt (which means you're leading) You have a binary deciscion to make- you can guess one, saying you will take the trick, or 0 saying that you won't take the trick. You have three peices of information- the card in your hand, how many other players there are, and one card you know is out of the game (one card is flipped over to select the trump at the start of each round).\n",

You should bet 1 if there is a more than 50% chance you will win the hand, otherwise 0. "
